# flask_luggage
#I'm working on a Python Flask web app to manage luggage storage at a hotel's bellstand.
#The app consists of a simple input form to store information to a MySQL database table,
#Similar to this:
#Last Name:_____________
#Ticket #:______________
#Location:______________
#Bag Count:_____________
#Stored By:_____________
#Time In:_______________

#And then bellmen would be able to query the database table to quickly locate the luggage 
#when the guest is ready to retrieve their bags.

#A total of 2 tables are needed for this application: the guests table, and the logged in users table (bellmen).
